# Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science etc.

## Introduction
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the concept of having machines “think like humans”.</li>
<li>Perform tasks like reasoning, planning, learning, and understanding language.</li>
<li>The brains behind artificial intelligence is a technology called machine learning.</li>
</ul>

## Applications
<ul>
<li>Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Home, Amazon Echo Alexa act as your personal assistants using voice processing.</li>
<li>Amazon recommends products using machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Facebook recommends photo tags using image recognition.</li>
<li>Waze suggests optimal driving routes using a combination of predictive models, forecasting, and optimization techniques.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges of AI technology
<ul>
<li>It takes a specialized team of data scientists and developers to access the correct data, prepare the data, build the correct models, and then integrate the predictions back into an end-user experience such as CRM.</li>
</ul>

## What does it take to kick off an AI project?
<ol type="1">
<li>Frame the business problem.</li>
<li>Figure out the data that’s available to solve the problem</li>
<li>Assign significant resources and infrastructure to tackle it.</li>
</ol>

## What AI can give you that you don't have yet?
<ol type="1">

<li>Predictive Scoring</li>
<ul>
<li>When Einstein gives you a score, it will also give you insight into how it was arrived at. For example, predictive lead scoring gives each sales lead a score representing the likelihood it will convert into an opportunity. You also get the reasons behind the score — for instance the lead source, the industry, or some other factor is an especially strong indicator that a lead will or won’t convert.</li>
</ul>

<li>Forecasting</li>
<ul>
<li>The predictive capabilities of AI aren’t limited to scoring; they can also be used to predict the future value of something, like a stock portfolio or a real estate investment. If you’re a sales manager, AI can predict your quarterly bookings and let you know ahead of time whether or not your team is on track to meet its quota.</li>
</ul>

<li>Recommendations</li>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who shops online knows that AI makes suggestions for retail purchases, but it can also make smart recommendations for any other product or service category from business software to tax consulting to cargo containers. And AI can also recommend things other than products — for instance, which white paper you should email a prospect in order to optimize your chance to close a deal.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
