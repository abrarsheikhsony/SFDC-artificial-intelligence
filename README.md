# Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Science etc.

## Introduction
<ul>
<li>We are at an evolutionary tipping point. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a paradigm shift, disruption "or" massive change in technology.</li>
<li>AI is the concept of having machines “think like humans”.</li>
<li>Perform tasks like reasoning, planning, learning, and understanding language.</li>
<li>AI is about building intelligent computer programs that carry out tasks like: Visual perception, Speech recognition, Sentiment analysis</li>  
<li>The brains behind artificial intelligence is a technology called machine learning.</li>
<li>AI is not killer robots. It’s killer technology!</li>
<li>AI is finally possible because of: Cloud Computing, general problem solver, paradigm shift.</li>
</ul>

## Applications
<ul>
<li>Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Home, Amazon Echo Alexa act as your personal assistants using voice processing.</li>
<li>Amazon recommends products using machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>Facebook recommends photo tags using image recognition.</li>
<li>Waze (a GPS and maps app) suggests optimal driving routes using a combination of predictive models, forecasting, and optimization techniques.</li>
</ul>

## Use Cases in CRM
<ul>

<li>Sales</li>
<ul>
<li>Automatically capture sales activities.</li>
<li>Automatically log customer data.</li>
<li>Suggest next-best actions and recommended email responses.</li>
</ul>

<li>Service</li>
<ul>
<li>Automatically classify and route cases.</li>
<li>Recommend solutions and knowledge articles.</li>
<li>Self-service communities and automated assistants.</li>
</ul>

<li>Marketing</li>
<ul>
<li>Automatically score likelihood to open an email or subscribe to a newsletter.</li>
<li>Deliver the next best product, content, or offer.</li>
<li>Send messages at the right time, when a customer is most likely to engage.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

## Challenges of AI technology
<ul>
<li>It takes a specialized team of data scientists and developers to access the correct data, prepare the data, build the correct models, and then integrate the predictions back into an end-user experience such as CRM.</li>
</ul>

## What does it take to kick off an AI project?
<ol type="1">
<li>Frame the business problem.</li>
<li>Figure out the data that’s available to solve the problem</li>
<li>Assign significant resources and infrastructure to tackle it.</li>
</ol>

## What AI can give you that you don't have yet?
<ol type="1">

<li>Predictive Scoring</li>
<ul>
<li>When Einstein gives you a score, it will also give you insight into how it was arrived at. For example, predictive lead scoring gives each sales lead a score representing the likelihood it will convert into an opportunity. You also get the reasons behind the score — for instance the lead source, the industry, or some other factor is an especially strong indicator that a lead will or won’t convert.</li>
</ul>

<li>Forecasting</li>
<ul>
<li>The predictive capabilities of AI aren’t limited to scoring; they can also be used to predict the future value of something, like a stock portfolio or a real estate investment. If you’re a sales manager, AI can predict your quarterly bookings and let you know ahead of time whether or not your team is on track to meet its quota.</li>
</ul>

<li>Recommendations</li>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who shops online knows that AI makes suggestions for retail purchases, but it can also make smart recommendations for any other product or service category from business software to tax consulting to cargo containers. And AI can also recommend things other than products — for instance, which white paper you should email a prospect in order to optimize your chance to close a deal.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

## Building Blocks of AI technology
<ol type="1">

<li>Machine Learning</li>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning is the core driver of AI. It’s the concept of having computers learn from data with minimal programming.</li>
<li>Machine learning works with structured data to detect patterns that provide insight and personalized recommendations.</li>
<li>Sales — It can analyze information from email, calendars, and CRM data to proactively recommend actions like the best email response to move a deal forward.</li>
<li>Service — It can automatically classify cases and intelligently route them to the right service agent.</li>
<li>Marketing — It can intelligently score the likelihood of a customer to open an email, subscribe to a newsletter, or make a purchase.</li>
</ul>

<li>Deep Learning</li>
<ul>
<li>Deep learning is AI that uses complex algorithms to perform tasks in domains where it actually learns the domain with little or no human supervision.</li>
<li>In essence, the machine learns how to learn.</li>
<li>Deep learning is great at automatically learning the best features from somewhat noisy data (read: unstructured) so that algorithms can learn more effectively.</li>
<li>Most practical applications are based on image analysis.</li>
<li>With image analysis, a computer learns to classify random images by analyzing thousands or millions of other images and their data points.</li>
<li>Examples: Google Photos and Facebook use deep learning to power face recognition in photos.</li>
<li>Sales — It can analyze product images attached to a deal and use that information to suggest the best upsell and cross-sell opportunities.</li>
<li>Service — It can analyze images of a product attached to a service case and use the information to classify the case and route it to the right agent.</li>
<li>Marketing — It can analyze images across Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter to suggest the best visuals for an upcoming advertising campaign. It can even identify brands in the images whether or not they’re mentioned in the text.</li>
</ul>

<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<ul>
<li>NLP is AI that recognizes language and its many usage and grammar rules by finding patterns within large datasets.</li>
<li>It can perform sentiment analysis, where algorithms look for patterns in social media postings to understand how customers feel about a specific brand or product.</li>
<li>It handles speech recognition, providing a text summary derived from “listening” to an audio clip of a human speaking.</li>
<li>I conducts question answering, typically handling those questions with a specific answer (for example, What is the square root of 4?), but also exploring how to handle more complex and open-ended questions.</li>
<li>Example: One application of NLP that’s gaining traction is sentiment analysis within social media. Computers use algorithms to look for patterns in user posts across Twitter, Facebook, or other social networks to understand how customers feel about a specific brand or product.</li>
<li>Sales — NLP can dig through the text of emails exchanged with customers to estimate the likelihood of a potential sale, detect the best possible deals, identify deals a team is at greatest risk of losing, and provide recommended actions to improve the sales process.</li>
<li>Service — NLP can help route and more efficiently respond to customer emails by analyzing the written content.</li>
<li>Marketing — NLP can be used for sentiment analysis on text to understand how customers feel about your specific brand and products.</li>
</ul>
